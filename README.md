# stock-market-prediction-using-random-forest

# The goal of this machine learning project is to develop a predictive model for stock market indices such as the S&P 500. The model is based on the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, a popular machine learning technique that uses an ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. The model is trained on historical stock market data, including price, volume, and other relevant features. The trained model can then be used to predict future stock market trends and index values. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results of the project can be used by investors and financial analysts to make informed decisions about stock market investments.
